# Concordia Bootcamp Workshop Fall 2021

## Objective

Your challenge is to build a newsfeed app with Contentful API from Dialogue's account.

## Brief

Your task is to build out the Dialogue blog! There are images in `/design` and you can also view the blog at https://www.dialogue.co/en/blog. The base app is already setup with `Roboto` and `Playfair Display` fonts in weights 400, 500, and 700. You can view these fonts on fonts.google.com.

In this workshop you will have:

- Written a GET request to an API with query parameters
- Built a UI that shows the latest featured blog article
- Built a UI that shows the 6 latest blog articles ordered by date (not including featured article)
- Implemented functional category buttons
- Implemented a "load more" button that gets the next 6 articles

**Important things to note before starting**

This is a one day workshop. You are not going to build out an exact replica of Dialogue's blog!

- You do not need to build out the blog header, footer, or article search bar
- You will need to use a placeholder image service for the article images. Try placeholder.com or placecage.com
- You do not need to build out the individual article page

## Getting started

Written for users on mac, may vary slightly for PC or chromebook users. You should be on node version 16.

1. Fork this repo & download the fork onto your computer
2. Navigate into the directory in your terminal `cd Folder_where_you_placed_repo/concordia-fall-2021`
3. Install the packages `yarn install`
4. Start the app in development mode `yarn start`
5. You should now see the base app at http://localhost:3000/

If you want to run unit tests, run `yarn test`.
