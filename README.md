# Concordia Bootcamp Workshop Fall 2021

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). See further down to learn more!

## Objective

Your challenge is to build a newsfeed app with Contentful API from Dialogue's account.

## Brief

Your task is to build out the Dialogue blog! There are images in `/design` and you can also view the blog at https://www.dialogue.co/en/blog. The base app is already setup with `Roboto` and `Playfair Display` fonts in weights 400, 500, and 700. You can view these fonts on fonts.google.com.

In this workshop you will have:

- Written a GET request to an API with query parameters
- Built a UI that shows the latest featured blog article
- Built a UI that shows the 6 latest blog articles ordered by date (not including featured article)
- Implemented functional category buttons
- Implemented a "load more" button that gets the next 6 articles

**Important things to note before starting**

This is a one day workshop. You are not going to build out an exact replica of Dialogue's blog!

- You do not need to build out the blog header, footer, or article search bar
- You will need to use a placeholder image service for the article images. Try placeholder.com or placecage.com
- You do not need to build out the individual article page

## Getting started

Written for users on mac, may vary slightly for PC or chromebook users. You should be on node version 16.

1. Download ZIP of the repo
2. Unzip and place wherever (for this example we're using Desktop)
3. Navigate into the directory in your terminal `cd Desktop/concordia-fall-2021`
4. Install the packages `yarn install`
5. Start the app in development mode `yarn start`
6. You should now see the base app at http://localhost:3000/

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
